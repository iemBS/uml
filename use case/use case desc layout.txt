Use Case Descriptions are textual and can be used to create Use Case Diagrams (type of UML diagram)


Layout
--------------------
[xxx: add optional parts to layout]
Use Case [#] [name]
Actors: [name 1]:[def 1], [name 2]:[def 2]
Note: 
  - 
Preconditions:
  - 
Main Success Scenario:
  1.
Alternatives:
  1a. 
Exceptions:
  1a. 


Parts of Layout explained
----------------------------
Use Case #: 
  - Optional part of a use case description if use case can be identified easy enough with it's name/title
  - Allows for grouping of several use case descriptions into Use Case sets
  - Uniquely identifies a use case
Use Case name/title:   
  - Required part of use case desc
  - Start with an action
Actors:
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - Bolding actor names in "Main Success Scenario" also helps
  - each actor has a name and a definition
Level: 
  - indicates level in process
Priority:
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - Indicator of use case important
Description: 
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - Brief desc of what the use case does
Created by: 
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - author of the use case
Revision History:
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - chronology of use case changes
Preconditions: 
  - Optional part of use case desc
  - What needs to be true before use case begins
  - Use some sort of bullet point instead of numbers or letters because order is not important in this section
Triggers:
  - Event(s) that start use case
Main Success Scenario: 
  - Required part of use case description
  - This is the ideal scenario that will occur
  - Nothing goes wrong in this scenario
  - Try to keep this to 10 steps or less
  - Try to start each step w an actor and follow that with an action
  - Nice for readability if step is on a single line
Alternatives:  
  - Not a required part of a use case desc
  - An alternate scenario that can occur for step(s) in the Main Success Scenario
  - Numbering is Main Success Scenario step number with a letter next to it
    - First alternate scenario is Xa if X is the Main Success Scenario step
    - Second alternate scenario is Xb, third, Xc, and so on. 
  - All, some, or none of the Main Success Scenario steps can have an alternate scenario
  - If an alternate scenario of Xa is noted, then the first step of that alt scenario is Xa1. Second is Xa2. 
  - You can do alternatives within each alternative scenario, but it may be better to just reference another use case
  - These scenarios are less frequent than the main success scenario
  - If "Exceptions" section is not used, then these can be successful and not successful scenarios
  - If "Exceptions" section is used, then these are alternate successful scenarios
Exceptions: 
  - Not a required part of a use case desc
  - Alternate scenarios that lead to an unsuccessful conclusion
Guarantee:
  - Not a required part of a use case desc
